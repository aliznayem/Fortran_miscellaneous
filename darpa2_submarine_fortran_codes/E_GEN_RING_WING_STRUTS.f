C
C THIS PROGRAM DEFINES THE STRUT WHICH ATTACHES THE
C  DARPA2 AXISYMMETRIC HULL TO THE DARPA2 RING WINGS.
C  THE SAME BASIC STRUT IS USED TO ATTACH BOTH
C  RING WING 1 AND RING WING 2. THE UPPER PORTION OF
C  THE STRUT MUST BE MODIFIED TO FIT EACH WING.
C
C THIS PROGRAM DEFINES A SINGLE STRUT WHICH WOULD
C  ATTACH TO THE DARPA2 AXISYMMETRIC HULL ALONG
C  THE UPPER SURFACE (I.E., THE SURFACE WITH THE
C  FAIRWATER). FOUR IDENTICAL AXIMUT~'LLY EQUALLYSPACED STRUTS WILL ATTACH THE RING WING AND THE HULL
C  AT A 45 DEGREE INCREMENT FROM THE SURFACE PRESSURE
C  TAP LOCATIONS. THE STRUTS WILL BE PLACED
C  AT 90 DEGREE INCREMENTS.
C
C THE BASIC STRUT SHAPE IS A NACA 0012 THICKNESS
C  DISTRIBUTION MODIFIED TO END AT A POINT.
C  THE CHORD LENGTH IS 0.25 FEET.

C STRUT LEADING EDGE ATTACHES TO:
C    HULL        AT X=13.589,   R=0.14726
C    RING WING 1 AT x=13.63845, R=0.36886 (X/C=0.233)
C    RING WING 2 AT x=13.64487, R=0.39755 (X/C=0.25)
C TRUT TRAILING EDGE ATTACHES TO:
C    HULL        AT X=13.83582, R=0.10547
C    RING WING 1 AT=13.88818,   R=0.34002 (X/C=0.5651)
